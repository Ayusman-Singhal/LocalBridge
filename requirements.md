# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LocalBridge is a self-hosted web application that enables seamless file transfer, clipboard synchronization, and text sharing between a PC and mobile devices over a local network connection. The application runs entirely offline, requiring no internet connectivity or external services, making it ideal for secure local data exchange via USB tethering or Wi-Fi connections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local Web Server

**User Story:** As a user, I want to run a local web server on my PC, so that I can access LocalBridge services from my mobile device through a web browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL launch a local HTTP server on a configurable port (default 5000)
2. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL display the local network URL (e.g., http://192.168.42.1:5000) in the console
3. WHEN the server is running THEN the system SHALL be accessible from any device on the same local network
4. WHEN the server encounters a port conflict THEN the system SHALL automatically try the next available port
5. WHEN the server stops THEN the system SHALL gracefully close all connections and release the port

### Requirement 2: File Transfer Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to transfer files between my PC and mobile device, so that I can easily share documents, images, and other files without using cloud services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a file upload area for mobile-to-PC transfers
2. WHEN I select files on my mobile device THEN the system SHALL allow uploading multiple files simultaneously
3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL save them to a designated folder on the PC
4. WHEN I access the file browser THEN the system SHALL display PC files available for download
5. WHEN I click on a file THEN the system SHALL initiate download to my mobile device
6. WHEN I drag and drop files in the upload area THEN the system SHALL accept and process the files
7. WHEN file transfer is in progress THEN the system SHALL display upload/download progress indicators

### Requirement 3: Clipboard Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sync clipboard content between my PC and mobile device, so that I can easily copy text from one device and paste it on another.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the clipboard section THEN the system SHALL display the current PC clipboard content
2. WHEN the PC clipboard changes THEN the system SHALL update the displayed content automatically
3. WHEN I enter text in the clipboard input field THEN the system SHALL copy that text to the PC clipboard
4. WHEN I submit clipboard text THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation of successful clipboard update
5. WHEN clipboard content is empty THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4: Quick Notes Sharing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share quick notes and text snippets between devices, so that I can exchange information without using the clipboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the notes section THEN the system SHALL display a shared text area
2. WHEN I type in the text area THEN the system SHALL save the content automatically
3. WHEN I access the notes from another device THEN the system SHALL display the same shared content
4. WHEN notes are updated THEN the system SHALL persist the changes across sessions
5. WHEN the text area is cleared THEN the system SHALL remove the stored notes

### Requirement 5: Web Interface Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive web interface, so that I can easily use LocalBridge on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-friendly responsive design
2. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation elements
3. WHEN I interact with interface elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display all core features (file transfer, clipboard, notes) in organized sections
5. WHEN I use touch gestures THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to mobile interactions

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want LocalBridge to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue using the service even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and allow retry
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL show connection status and attempt reconnection
3. WHEN invalid files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL reject them with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue operating when possible
5. WHEN clipboard operations fail THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide alternative options

### Requirement 7: Performance Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want LocalBridge to perform efficiently, so that file transfers and interface interactions are responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files up to 100MB are uploaded THEN the system SHALL complete the transfer within 30 seconds on a typical local network
2. WHEN the web interface loads THEN the system SHALL display the main page within 2 seconds on mobile devices
3. WHEN clipboard content is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect changes within 1 second
4. WHEN multiple files are uploaded simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle up to 10 concurrent uploads
5. WHEN the notes section is accessed THEN the system SHALL load and save content within 500ms

### Requirement 8: Basic Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want LocalBridge to have basic security measures, so that my local system remains protected from common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations occur THEN the system SHALL validate file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
2. WHEN uploads are processed THEN the system SHALL implement reasonable file size limits (default 500MB per file)
3. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL validate file types and reject potentially harmful executables
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL bind only to local network interfaces by default
5. WHEN invalid requests are made THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring

## Future Enhancements

The following features are identified for potential future development:

- **Fixed IP/Hostname Support**: Option to set a consistent hostname (e.g., `http://localbridge.local:5000`) for stable URL access
- **QR Code Generation**: Automatic QR code generation for quick mobile access to the service URL
- **Real-time Clipboard Sync**: WebSocket-based real-time clipboard synchronization without page refresh
- **Multiple File Drag-and-Drop**: Enhanced drag-and-drop interface supporting multiple file selection
- **Remote PC Control**: Basic keyboard/mouse control capabilities through the web interface
